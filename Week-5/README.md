# Week 5: Obtain and visualize FASTQ data from SRA

## Write a Bash script:
- Reuse and expand your code from last week.
- Create a bash shell script with the code from last week.
- Add commands to download at least one sequencing dataset using the SRR number(s).
- Download only a subset of the data that would provide approximately 10x genome coverage. Briefly explain how you estimated the amount of data needed for 10x coverage.

```

```

## Quality assessment:
- Generate basic statistics on the downloaded reads (e.g., number of reads, total bases, average read length).
- Run FASTQC on the downloaded data to generate a quality report.
- Evaluate the FASTQC report and summarize your findings.

## Compare sequencing platforms:
- Search the SRA for another dataset for the same genome, but generated using a different sequencing platform (e.g., if original data was Illumina select PacBio or Oxford Nanopore).
- Briefly compare the quality or characteristics of the datasets from the two platforms.
