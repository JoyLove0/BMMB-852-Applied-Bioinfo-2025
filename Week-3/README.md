# Assigment 3

Address the following:

## Use IGV to visualize your genome and the annotations relative to the genome.
## How big is the genome, and how many features of each type does the GFF file contain?
## From your GFF file, separate the intervals of type "gene" or "transcript" into a different file. Show the commands you used to do this.
## Visualize the simplified GFF in IGV as a separate track. Compare the visualization of the original GFF with the simplified GFF.
## Zoom in to see the sequences, expand the view to show the translation table in IGV. Note how the translation table needs to be displayed in the correct orientation for it to make sense.
## Visually verify that the first coding sequence of a gene starts with a start codon and that the last coding sequence of a gene ends with a stop codon.
## Report your findings in text, and provide the code for the commands you ran in your markdown report.
