# Description
This is for the class BMMB 852: Applied Bioinformatic that took place in the Fall 2025. 

This course designed for students with biology backgrounds, focusing on the computational analysis and interpretation of biological data. It covers high-throughput sequencing applications such as ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, SNP calling, metagenomics, and de novo assembly. Students will work through complete data analysis workflows, learn to use a variety of bioinformatics tools, understand common data formats and standards, and develop the computational skills needed for large-scale biological data analysis.

Each week there will be directory created for relevant homework assignments, notes, images, etc.
